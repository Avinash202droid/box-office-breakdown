# IMDb Movie Success Analysis

This project explores key factors behind movie success using IMDb's Top 1000 Movies dataset. We conducted detailed data cleaning, exploratory analysis using Python, and created interactive visual dashboards using Tableau. The goal: uncover what drives IMDb ratings and identify patterns in runtime, genre, certification, and directors.
